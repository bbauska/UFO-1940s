Udo Andree Wartena (July 22, 1903 - December 15, 1989) was a Dutch-born gold miner who was reported by Warren Aston to have told friends in 1989, near the end of his life, that he had sighted a disc-shaped object and encountered its pilots during May 1940 while prospecting at the base of Boulder Mountain near Confederate Gulch in Broadwater County, Montana.

It is no longer an option to say UFOs are not real. You can still have an
opinion about what they are, but you no longer have an option. And anyone who feels that UFOs are not real, and I know
I'm speaking to the converted largely here this morning, that anyone who feels that way simply is uninformed.
However, despite this impressive backdrop of evidence, many vital questions do remain unanswered. And even
we as researchers and people who are interested have yet to reach agreement on some of the most basic and essential
issues. Now among other things, what I'm suggesting today is that there is
another approach to the data that we should be following and I think far more
so than has been done until now. A complimentary approach. Now, my work on
the particular case that Chris mentioned that dates back to 1940 that has convinced me over the last few years of
research that as we collect all this data, these thousands, hundreds of thousands of sightings, we must also be
careful not to overlook the potential value that analysis of any one
particular case can yield. Now, of course, the value that we can attach to any single case depends on many factors
and not least the credibility of the witness or witnesses. Now, the case I'm going to
give you this morning is in my opinion a superb example of the insight that this complimentary second approach can yield.
This detailed and straightforward report, which has been out of the UFO
circle until, in fact, unpublished in UFO circles until just three months ago,
is the most revealing and informative of any claimed alien encounter that I've studied in my time. There's not the
slightest hint of any deception, evasion, or fraud in the story. The
witness enjoyed the highest imaginable endorsement for his integrity and honesty which was often given to me by
those who knew him best uh unsolicited. So the evidence overwhelmingly points to
his experiences having actually occurred. And if that is so, then we have at least part of the question about
UFOs and their origins decisively answered. And I'll be giving some other
reasons later on uh why I believe we have to accept this as a genuine case. Now my motives in presenting this case
and saying all the good things about it that I will and have are as follows.
Firstly, I believe that all the evidence suggests that this is a genuine extraterrestrial
encounter. It has no dimensional metaphysical overtones.
I think that with an anniversary theme for this conference, 50 years of eupfology, it's an appropriate and
timely reminder for all of us to re-evaluate our methodology, the way we're going about it and look at the
system and the and the process that we're using to sort out the data. Secondly,
this particular case has, as I've mentioned, never been published in UFO literature before, and I believe it deserves to be placed on record as
perhaps one of the most preeminent cases of its kind. And lastly, the information
which we can derive from this case, I believe tells us a lot about the agenda for this planet of at least one of these
alien groups. Now, before we review what happened in this report, which is deceptively
simple, we must remember that this is an unusually early case. It took place pre
1947 in a period that has yielded only small numbers of UFO sightings worldwide
and almost no cases where the occupants of UFOs were reported. You can count them on the fingers of one, maybe two
hands. The witness Udo Wartner,
his experience took place in daytime and it involved intimate and open alien contact with a reluctant witness who
kept his experience to himself, not even telling his wife, for nearly 30 years
after the event. So I've assembled the the following account which I'll read to you now from two handwritten accounts
and one typewritten account by the witness and from verbal recollections through interviews with a handful of
close friends and family members whom he eventually confided in.
The photo was taken of Udo approximately four years before the experience.
Midm morning early in May 1940, Udo was at his mining claim which was a
short distance from a lake near the small town of Towns End near Helena in Montana. At the time he was 37 years
old. He was a minor of Dutch origin and he was working in the area part-time for
the Northwest Mining Company. During the previous month, he had found a glacial deposit at the base of a nearby mountain
which showed indications of goldbearing ore, and he began working the site in his spare time. To do so, he first
cleared an old and neglected ditch which ran around the mountain side, using it to divert the water that he would need
for his mining from a nearby stream. And on the morning in question, while
moving some large boulders, he heard a humming or droning sound, which he first took to be army aircraft, which flew
over the area occasionally from the Great Falls base in the north. At first, Udo took little notice of the sound, but
when it continued, he thought that a truck had driven up, and he climbed up onto higher ground.
A large discshaped object measuring about 35 ft high and over 100 ft across.
So, it's a large one, was hovering a short distance away, just above the meadow where he had built his dam.
Thinking at first it was an airship, he described it as like two soup plates, one inverted over the other, and
resembling stainless steel in color, though not as bright and shiny. Of course, he had not seen stainless steel
like anyone else at that point. This is in retrospect. Now you've got to remember this is 1940. This is 7 years
before any media attention came to the subject. This is before the sound
barrier was broken, before any satellites had ever been launched. You need to keep that in perspective as
you as you listen to his response. As Udo stood watching, a circular
stairway with a solid bottom forming part of the craft's hull was let down.
and the man came down this and started walking towards him. As I was somewhat more than interested,
Udo later wrote, I went to meet him. He stopped when we were about 10 or 12 feet apart. He was a nicel looking man,
seemingly about my age, in other words, mid-30s perhaps. He wore a light gray pair of coveralls,
a tam, which was a term a common term in that period meaning just a circular cap
of the same material on his head and on his feet were slippers or moccasins.
The man came and shook his hand and apologized that they had not known anyone was in
the area. I found that very refreshing.
He explained that it was not their custom to interrupt or allow themselves to be seen. He asked me if it was all
right if they took some of the water. As I said, could not see why not. I said, "Sure." He then gave a signal when a
hose or pipe was let down. His English was like mine, but he spoke slowly as if
he were a linguist and had to pick his way. The man asked Udo what he was doing, and
this was explained. Udo was then asked if he'd be interested in coming aboard the ship and went willingly and without
any sense of fear. As he got underneath the hovering craft, Udo described the humming sound as not
loud, though it seemed to go through you. But once inside the ship, the noise was hardly noticeable except what came
up the stairwell. Then he writes, "We entered into a room about 12 by 16 ft with a close-fitting
sliding door on the farther end. indirect lighting near the ceiling and nice upholstered benches around the
sides. There was an older man already in the room, plainly dressed, but his hair was
snow white. I then noticed that the younger man's hair was also white.
Udo described the men as being young and strongl looking and having clear, almost translucent skin. And perhaps this
explains the curious fact that he seems to have asked the men their age even before asking their origin. Clearly,
there was something about their appearance prompting his inquiry. And the men answered that one was about 600
years old as we measured time and the other was over 900. So about 600 and
over 900 years of age. They also informed him that they knew over 500 languages and were learning
ours and improving upon them all the time. When he asked why they wanted to take
water from the stream and not from the lake which is nearby, the younger of the
two men replied that the water was good and was free from algae as if they had
gotten the same before and it was convenient. Many years later, Udo indicated to a
family member that I interviewed that hydrogen extracted from the water was in fact the fuel source for the craft.
Udo then asked what caused the noise of the craft and was not only shown the mechanism that powered the disc but was
given what appears to be a full and open albeit basic discussion of the key
principles involved in the following words. This is what the man told him. As you
noticed we are floating above the ground and though the ground slopes the ship is level. There are in the outside room of
the ship two flywheels, one turning one way and the other in the opposite direction.
He then went on to explain to you though that this the action of these two revolving wheels or rings gave the ship
its own gravitational pull, its own gravitational
force or rather overcame the gravitational force of the Earth and other planets, the sun and stars. And
though this pull is but light, we use this gravitational pull of the stars and planets to ride on like you do when you
slide on ice. An interesting analogy when you think of it. Elsewhere, Udo described these rings
or flywheels as being about 3 ft wide, several inches thick, and they were separated by rods turned by motors and
next to battery or transformer-like units all around the inside perimeter of the circular ship.
He was told that these two rings or wheels developed an electromagnetic force. Now, this was a term he didn't
understand at the time, but he inferred from what he learned that the ability to
develop a cheaper and more practical energy source was of the utmost importance to mankind. He was also told
that the craft was able to focus on a distant star and use the energy to draw
itself through space at speeds faster than light. and they used the specific phrase skipping upon the light waves.
These two this quotation is I think a good representative example of some of
the current thinking about the possibilities of how faster than light travel might be achieved. This is by a
physicist in a book published uh 1994. It's interesting as you run your eyes
over it and I won't take time to dwell on this anymore but run your eyes over it and see how closely that mirrors the
description given by Robert Lazar so many years later about how the speed of
life can speed of light can be exceeded.
You can't read that. Okay. So let me just read it out quickly. The creation of a local distortion of spaceime is
expanded behind the spaceship and contracted ahead of it yielding a hyper
surfer-like motion faster than the speed of light as seen by observers. So in
essence on the outgoing leg of its journey the spaceship is pushed away from earth and pulled towards its
distance destination by the engineered local expansion of time space itself.
Now that is very very close to what Udo was told back in 1940.
I then asked them where they got the energy to run such a large ship. They said from the sun and other stars and
they would store this in batteries, though this was for emergency use only. They carried another source but did not
explain this to me. When then asked where they came from, the alien man replied that they lived on
a distant planet. gave its name, which unfortunately wasn't recorded, and pointing in its direction. Udo then
asked the man what their object was for coming to Earth. Well, he said, "As you have noticed, we look pretty much as you
do. So, we mingle with you people, gather information, leave instructions, or give help where needed."
explaining that they were monitoring the progression and retrogression of our societies. The man claimed that they
live among us from time to time, which is a gives us a clear statement indicating long-term covert alien
surveillance prior to 1940. Udo wrote that he did not understand
what was meant by them giving help where needed, but he didn't feel it was proper to ask about it further.
When Udo asked if they knew of Jesus Christ and about religion, the man responded, "We would like to speak of
these things, but are unable. We cannot interfere in any way."
During his time on board, he was invited to be examined for impurities in his system. This is their description of it
by an X-ray like machine, which is Udo's description of the process, and that passed over him as he lay on a table.
Little was recorded by him about this examination, however, and he seems to have attached little importance to it.
While talking with the two men, a light had come on, which Udo believed indicated that the water had been taken
care of, and he mentioned that he felt it was time for him to leave. The alien's response was to ask if he was
interested in going with them, to which he responded, "I said, I thought it would be interesting, but felt it would
inconvenience too many people." Later, I wondered why I said that.
Sometime later, he recalled an incident that had taken place about two years previously where a young man had
vanished in the same area without trace despite days of searching by a sheriff's team. And he wondered if the young man
had met the same craft and accepted the invitation. As he started to leave the ship, the men
suggested to Udo that he tell no one, as no one would believe me at that time. But in years to come, I could tell about
this experience. When I walked away from the ship, they raised the stairway, and when I got a couple of hundred feet away
from the ship, I turned around. A number of more port holes had opened up, and though I could not see anyone, I felt
sure they could see me. Anyway, I waved at them. The ship then rose straight up till it cleared the trees. Then, while
circling or wobbling, I think he means slightly, it practically rose straight
up and in a very short time was completely out of sight. As I didn't have a watch, I did not know for sure
how long I'd been with them, but according to the son, it was some it was around noon or somewhat around 2 hours.
He later related how some type of energy had permeated the area, and he had lost his strength for several hours, being
unable to walk. When his strength finally returned, he went over to where the huge craft had hovered, finding only
an area of crushed grass where the stairway had rested. Later still feeling overwhelmed by the experience he walked
back to his base camp. Now let's just analyze what has been
given us here. First of all something that comes across very strongly is a strong sense of
propriety seems to have prevailed throughout this encounter. Now unlike you or I perhaps if we found ourselves
in that situation you seems to have instinctively sensed the boundaries of appropriate questioning. I would have
delayed their departure. But he was very uh very considerate and
seems to have felt uh that some things were not right to talk about.
It seems clear from the whole experience that the taking aboard the craft of a considerable quantity of ordinary stream
water as a fuel source for perhaps a small, this is my speculation, perhaps a
small nuclear reactor of some kind was the sole purpose for the landing of the alien ship. Now I suggest that we accept
this as the probable explanation for the many cases when identified unidentified craft have been seen to extract water
from lakes and reservoirs and the like and that we can safely assume all this water is not required for the washing of
alien cutlery or some other mundane reason. Now a view of the implications
of what amounts to a waterfueled spacecraft. Can we also see in this a possible
reason for the cover up perhaps one of many by government and when we realize
further that some multinational corporations today have annual budgets far in excess of many smaller countries
the economic pressures to restrict such technology for military use must be
considerable. The familiarity with water supplies enabling the aliens to differentiate
between river and lake water suggests more than just the obvious fact that they had taken water from this location
previously. To me, it also implies an intimacy with the area that could only
have resulted from long-term activity in that place. In other words, that this was part of a regular pattern of
activity. As with so many subsequent reports, what
we are left with is the hints that there is a very simple propulsion system which
is capable of overcoming gravity laterally rather than directly opposing
it as we do with our own rocket propulsion systems. Udo's description of the counterrotating
rings providing one of the propulsion sources is consistent with so many other UFO reports describing revolving craft
or parts of a craft uh that I don't need to comment any further. A device 100 ft
in diameter would obviously generate enormous centrifugal forces and could
easily generate a substantial electrical output. But our conventional physics don't
predict any mechanism that would allow us to overcome gravity. So obviously
only the most basic elements of the craft were explained to this non-technical witness. Or perhaps he
simply failed to understand or record more than this. We don't know. But the discovery that Martin spoke about
yesterday um announced by scientists last year of a
rapidly spinning superconductor ring is a hint to me that we are perhaps close
to developing a similar system. I don't know if you can see that but can you see the similarity despite the
difference in the scale or size uh a rapidly spinning ring is involved.
There's no indication of any mother ship in the report that Udo has left us, but rather every indication that in this
instance at least, the large saucershaped craft that he observed was itself capable of interstellar travel.
Now, what do we make of this claim that sounds so nonsensical at first that the aliens were about 600 and over 900 Earth
years of age? Now these figures may seem excessive to us but in fact are
consistent with many subsequent cases. You know I find it interesting sometimes
to daydream about this and ponder what an individual could do a single individual could do a scientist for
example if you could personally observe and study any aspect of scientific interest over such a long period over a
period of centuries. Think what you could do if you were a geneticist. A geneticist
and also the possibilities of what an individual could achieve in a lifetime of that length.
It's worth noting that the 300 year age difference between the two men was apparent to him only in that the second
man looks slightly older. The parting advice of the aliens that
you to would be better to not tell others of experience until some years
had passed suggest to me something else. It suggests that their race may have had
countless opportunities throughout the galaxy for interactions with other worlds similar to ours and understood
the process of disclosure that would be necessary that would take place over time to less developed races.
But what I've spent a lot of time in recent years since I came across this
about what may be mean by meant by their statement that they give help where
needed. Now by their own statements and by their conduct, this race and I hope
all others operate under a strict non-interference code when interacting with a less developed race. But equally
clearly, alien help hasn't prevented wars, disease, famine, the atrocities
that ravage our planet still. So I've concluded eventually that the assistance being offered is probably primarily
limited to the gradual sharing of technology that will allow the human race to move beyond its traditional
preoccupation, which is tribal warfare, towards the stars and the necessary
re-evaluation of our place in the universe that this requires.
And to this end, I believe that as a minimum, our space programs and probably some other scientific endeavors have
long had and continue to have gentle nudges on a regular basis from those who
live and work among us, but whose real origins remain unsuspected. And now look
just very briefly at two statements on public record by the two men who are
more responsible for the development of the American space program than anyone else. Dr. Dr. Vena von Brawn both German
scientists who came out under operation paperclip and Dr. Herman Oberth
1959 we find ourselves faced by powers which are far stronger than we had hither to
assumed and whose base is at present unknown to us. Can he possibly be talking about Russia?
More I cannot say at present we are now engaged in entering into closer contact with those powers.
If anyone can come up with a suggestion as to who else he might be talking about other than some other assistants from
above, I'd be interested. Dr. Herman Oberth, who worked with him, his
colleague, was even more open. We cannot take the credit for our record advancement in certain scientific fields
alone. We have been helped when asked by whom, he stated, by the people of other
worlds. This is not hearsay. These are on
record. And what of the statement that the aliens knew over 500 languages? Now, at first reading, we may assume that
they had mastered over 500 of the 900 or more languages of Earth. But the context
suggested eventually to me that many and perhaps the majority of these 500 languages were those of worlds other
than Earth. But certainly no difficulty in communication was evident from this account. They were able to, excuse me,
convey technical concepts without problems and without the need of telepathy or any technical device.
As I've researched this case for the last three nearly four years, perhaps the most impressive aspect to me,
however, was Udo's emotional response to the alien men whom he met so
unexpectedly that spring morning. It's the constant and revealing theme that
permeates his accounts. They were men just like us. He said very nice chaps.
He felt remarkable love or comfort was how he expressed it. Love or comfort in
their presence. And he didn't want to leave them. Afterwards, he wished that he could see them again, and he made
frequent visits back to his mine in the years that followed, more in the hope that the craft would return than for
mining gold. However, he would have no further UFO experiences for the remainder of his life, and he died in
1989, aged 86 years. At times, as you read his original
accounts, he seems almost to regret not accepting the invitation to accompany
the aliens on their journey. And this is interesting in itself because it suggests to me the interesting
possibility that a human could travel in such a craft unharmed at faster than
light speeds and could presumably live on their planet just as they could live on ours without difficulty. So the whole
account for me and I hope for you paints an
overwhelmingly positive picture of these aliens and I qualify that by saying
these aliens as being an advanced air breathing humanlike and friendly race
from another solar system. They visit only to unobtrusively monitor our Earth civilizations. They live among us from
time to time, assisting and helping the progress of the human race, never interfering with the core beliefs that
make up our society. And so we're left to wonder how many other such landings
have gone unreported as this one nearly did and how much other activity by this particular group has simply remained
unobserved. Now in euphology
this case leaves us facing a lingering and an inescapable issue and it's a very
very difficult issue. What if anything can we learn about this experience in
relation to the claims of the contactees many of whom have reported since this
similar experiences now I'm quick to state that in my opinion the majority of contactee claims
are the UFO equivalent of the space junk that now s orbits our planet but I'm
also equally convinced that not all such cases are the result of overactive imaginations
inflated egos or fraudulent intent. I'll take his picture off in case anyone gets upset.
I've long felt a concern that the knee-jerk reaction against reports of
humanoids in association with a UFO, much less claimed contact, that
characterized mainstream eupfology for decades and still persists in some quarters, means that much potentially
valuable data has eluded us. How many other cases comparable to this have been
buried intentionally to the sneering epithet of space brothers or have simply
been lost with the passing of time as this case almost was?
More seriously, the rejection of the early contact claims has led to a situation today in eupfology which I
call the cover up within eupfology. Many researchers and groups today reject
out of hand any report where UFO occupants are described as being like us in appearance and any suggestion that
some aliens may therefore live among us incognito. And sadly, this bias extends to some of
the largest, most influential UFO groups who routinely censor and ignore
thousands of reports each year because the reported aliens don't fit their narrow preconceptions.
I wonder at times what historians of the future are going to make of such an inexplicable cover up within eupfology
which ignores so much evidence so completely. And there's another assumption within mainstream eupfology
that's continued to hold back our understanding of what's going on every bit as much as the frauds and the
hoaxes. The natural but simplistic assumption of so many eupfologists even
today that we are being visited by just one alien race has also le led to the
rejection of reports that don't fit the chosen mold. But anyone familiar with the data the full data would have to be
forced to conclude that we're being visited by a great variety of beings and not all of them fit the Hollywood
promoted stereotype. Now, if we define a contact e as one
claiming a physical encounter and two-way communication with an apparent extraterrestrial. Now, um this is
separate from channeling or other paranormal activities. Udo Wartner was certainly one of the
very first, perhaps the first contactee that we know of. There's much in his account that stands unique among early
contacties as well as preempting those who began claiming contact from the 1950s to the present day. In contrast to
almost all other priadms contact claims, for example, Udo's aliens arrived in a
physical spacecraft. Now, that might sound a stupid comment to make, but in fact, only a handful of cases prior to
1940 exist where UFO entities were reported worldwide. And almost without
exception, all of these took place without any communication taking place. And even more incredible
that it may seem to us now, almost every other reported contact case previous to
1952 relied on astral travel or some other teleportation or psychic device in order
to meet with those of other worlds. Furthermore, for more than two years
after the writer Emanuel Swedenborg's Odyssey through the galaxy, which was published
back in 1758, every claimed contact with alien life was confined almost totally to origins
within our known solar system, in particular Mars, Venus, and the moon.
Now, while belief in the existence of intelligent life elsewhere in our solar
system persisted until at least the 1960s, Udo's aliens claimed to be from a far
distant planet, which was clearly not one of our sister worlds. The claim for an origin in our own solar system and
the other elements that are so common as to be almost universal in accounts by later contactees are totally missing in
this unplanned accidental meeting with aliens. One general trend of contacties
particularly since sorry prior to the 1970s has been to claim alien communication by
telepathic means and to receive metaphysical messages which have often assumed a religious context and
sometimes led to the formation of religions and cults. We see none of this in Udo's account which to me further
strengthens its credibility. The alien spoke to him in English claimed proficiency in many other languages.
There was no proceliting. No messages were given. Although they were free to disclose their origin. What
what they did disclose is is basically everything with one exception. Their origin, their personal details,
propulsion sources, aspects of their mission on Earth is these aliens
maintained a strict policy with regard to religion and cultural matters as we
would expect from an advanced and ethical society. Although Udo was himself devoutly
religious, he didn't see his experience at all in religious or spiritual terms,
but just as a straightforward physical meeting with men like us from another planet. Now, these exceptions to the
general rule of such cases are impressive enough, but there's more. Several significant elements that we
today regard as standard in both UFO sightings and in contact cases seem to
appear first in Udo Wardner's experience. The shape and dimensions of the craft itself, the extractions of
large quantities of ordinary water, the use of that water as a fuel source, the
great age of the aliens, the claim for faster than light travel, the medical examination when inside, the apparent
use of more than one propulsion system upon takeoff, the electromagnetic
effects experienced. And these are just some of the things that have since come to be commonly reported.
Now, there's always been a very real danger in euphology that we can perpetuate or create for ourselves
arbitrary paradigms that reflect individual or collective biases rather
than reality, which is what we're seeking to understand. Now, this has happened in the past and euphology is
the poorer for it. Now I can understand why mainstream eupfology was repelled by
some of the more fantastic claims of the early contacties in particular and most of them were dismissed with little or no
serious investigation. And yet this is where it gets complicated. There's another side to the coin. This very
element of the absurd is just what we should have expected. according to
sociologists who have now studied the possible strategies that a benevolent and ethical alien race would adopt in
making gradual contact with a developing race. And so I raised the question for
you to answer yourself in your own way. Could it be time to re-evaluate some of those early cases that seemed at the
time to belong to the lunatic fringe?
The basic theme of my talk this morning, as I said, is that after some 50 years
of euphology and research and data collecting, euphology, I believe, now
has the right to expect some answers. So, in keeping with that thought, I'd now like to discuss an aspect of modern
science that relates specifically not only to what Udo reported, but is also of great relevance to UFO research in
general. This is called nanotechnology. Now simply expressed nanotechnology is
the anticipated ability to manufacture anything through the control of matter
at the molecular or the atomic level. Nano of course means billionth. Now this
will require mastery of the very nature of physical matter. But I think it's important we understand that no new
fundamental science is needed. It's we're talking about an engineering advance. This picture here is showing
one of the very early steps where we have transistors on the head of a needle.
We're talking about even smaller than that. In nature, molecular machines,
nanotechnology if you like, already exists now. DNA, RNA, the enzymes that
make possible the reproduction and repair of cells in our body and that manufacture proteins are examples that
we're all aware of without realizing what they were. But now our own science is moving rapidly towards being able to
control matter at the most basic level. Chemists are making great progress in designing and synthesizing molecules
that bind to other molecules at specific sites. Thus allowing the same self
assembly and repairs that occur in nature. The 1987 Nobel Prize in
Chemistry was awarded for just such a breakthrough. In 1988, a group at Jupant
designed and fabricated a new protein that's more stable than natural proteins. And we now have tools in
science that allow us to see and to move, manipulate individual atoms. When
I was at high school, such a thing was completely impossible, beyond anything you could imagine or
conceive. But now they have physicists have electronic devices such as transistors that work at the molecular
level. So what do all of these impressive facts have to do with UDO and with UFOs in general? Simply this. I
believe that what we term nanotechnology is nothing less than a major aspect of
the alien technology that appears in our skies and sometimes on the ground as UFOs. And I say this because there are
some striking parallels between what nanotechnology predicts for the future even at this early stage and what we see
as UFOs. There are some equally fascinating correspondences between this developing
science and the statements made to Udo and to some other contactees. And let me
point out some of the things that nanotechnology foresees and put your UFO cap on if it's if it's fallen off in the
last minute and look at this from a UFO point of view. These are not my words.
These come from scientists involved in nanotechnology. Number one, material scientists and
engineers are already fabricating new materials called nano composites which
have electrical and mechanical properties unlike any other others known. Nanotechnology will make possible
the production of not only perfectly pure materials but also large crystals of material which would open up new uses
and processes. Now, just a few months ago this year, scientists in France and
in the United States announced the development of carbon nano tubes. And they described them as not only the
world's strongest material, those are strong words, no pun intended, but as
quite probably the strongest material that can be made. I won't go into the technical reasons why, but quite
possibly the strongest material that can be made. Roswell
buffs will be interested to know that one of the properties of this fiber is and I'm quoting it can crumple without
breaking then spring back to its original shape. If anyone's interested in that particularly I'll show you the
original material on this. It was meant to be printed in the proceedings somehow dropped out.
Number two, so we're talking about materials. Number two, the storage of information at a molecular level implies
that super advanced technology can be extremely compact and non-loized.
In other words, information storage technology may eventually be able to function much as quantum physics tells
us that our brains and consciousness do, unlimited by time and distance. Powerful
supercomputers smaller than anything now known could be developed. And one of these containing all of humanity's
knowledge could be mounted within our head, interface directly with our brain and result of course in an almost
omniscient being. These are not my words.
Number three, almost any material object. Now when I say when they say
any, they mean any. Whether you're talking about a desk, a battleship, a flying saucer, a bridge, a house, a car,
any material object could be manufactured without the limitation of conventional tools. Meaning that even
very large objects could be built as a single seamless piece rather than being
assembled as separate parts. It has become, of course, in case anyone
here is new to the subject, almost a standard description to describe a UFO and particularly the interior of a UFO
as being without seams, rivets or joints.
Number four, molecular machines could be designed to restore habitats to their natural state, remove specific isotopes
for nuclear waste, toxic chemicals from waters, can make deserts fertile, or even terraform whole planets to a
habitable state. Number five, molecular machines could be
programmed to destroy or repair diseased cells within the body. They could
rebuild damaged organs, restore missing limbs and restore defective organs to perfect
functioning. What would this do? Obviously, it would greatly increase our lifespan.
We could also give ourselves the ability to absorb almost 100% of whatever we eat, recycling what we normally excrete
and generating the nutrients within us that we need. We could breathe underwater. We could breathe in
different atmospheres. Number six, we could bring up other
organisms to a level of intelligence through this engineering similar to our own and we could create new intelligent
biological organisms to perform specific tasks for us.
Now my comment increasingly it seems that some of the beings reported piloting and crashing alien craft maybe
that's why so many crashes may be exactly this. I'll return to the
description. Number seven, nano machines could locate, read, and
then store the genetic information of every living species in a central repository, which among other things
could then be used to improve or recreate all species. These are not my words, promise.
Perhaps to repopulate a damaged habitat that has been restored.
And number eight, the speed of molecular machines would allow us to accomplish
tasks in seconds that take days or months and without the dangerous
processes, byproducts, and pollution we now have in our industry.
What this means in real terms is that the resulting economic revolution would
mean that we would eliminate very quickly economic, environmental, and social problems that plague our planet.
This would ensure that much more of our energy, time, and resources would be quickly freed up for more productive and
creative uses, exploring, exploiting the cosmos, for example. So, can you see
just from those descriptions how closely the promise of nanotechnology relates
directly to euphology? The statements made to Udo Wardner and to others look
much more believable when we see what our own science is predicting for our
near future. And they're talking in terms of years, not even decades. The performance characteristics of UFOs seem
more understandable when we envision what new materials might allow. aspects of the phenomenon that puzzle us
such as seamless craft, the lifespans many times ours, the whole abduction
aspect, the Bigfoot and robotic type creatures that are so often reported, they start to make some sense in view of
these new developments. So my personal feeling at the end of all of this is that when we describe alien technologies
as being millions of years in advance of us, I think we're probably way off the mark. Many may be only decades or maybe
a few hundred years ahead of us, perhaps thousands at most.
As with most things, however, there's a dark side to all of this. The wonderful promise of nanotechnology could also be
abused by amassing massive arsenals of weapons. Selfre
self-creating weapons. You could come up with a tremendous arsenal in very short time which would have much greater
potential for destruction than our current nuclear and biological weaponry. And on a more mundane level, the
economic advantage that would result from this alone would allow a nation, any nation or even a small group that
develops this ability to dominate all others.
Now, this is where it gets really interesting. The concept of nanotechnology of molecular machines was
first discussed as recently as the 1940s by a physicist called Richard Feainman.
But to my surprise last year while researching this I discovered that the other man credited with advancing these
concepts at about the same time the 1940s was none other than Dr. Vanavar
Bush. the same man that so many documents and sources name as a member and indeed the
senior member of MJ12. I ask, is that just coincidence
that what appears to be the whole basis for alien technology was a subject of great interest to Dr. Bush? If MJ12 had
access to at least one crashed UFO by 1947, as the evidence so clearly indicates, our emerging concepts of
nanotechnology now may owe much to recovered alien technology.
And of course, the reverse is true. Perhaps it's possible that Bush may have been chosen for his position on MJ12,
not only because of his broad background in various fields, including computers, but because he had already begun
developing some molecular concepts that would prove useful for understanding a crashed flying saucer. And that is true
whether the crash was accidental, as we commonly assume, or intentional, as some have suggested. But either way, a link
between alien technology or nanotechnology MJ12 and recovered alien craft is
indicated. So wherever the truth lies concerning a link between Vanavar Bush's
nanotechnology and crashed UFOs, we can be certain of one thing. The military and intelligence communities would have
the strongest interest in the applications of nanotechnology, no matter where it comes from. In the fast
past few years, a number of claims have been made that suggest that one product of nanotechnology in particular, and I'm
talking about biological computers that are years ahead of anything available
commercially, have already been covertly developed and put to work for the intelligence community.
There are some references in the proceedings if you want to look into that more. But if there's any truth in
these independently made claims, we see yet another link to eupfology and of
course another reason for a cover up. Finally, let me just direct some
thoughts to all of us as UFO researchers.
As we wade through government and military disinformation, through dimensional deception that I
referred to earlier, and through alien duplicity, we can, if we're not careful, find ourselves comfortably conditioned
into believing that the answers to the whole UFO enigma remain out there
forever tentative beyond our understanding or that the answers can be comprehended through simple scenarios.
Now I want to just mention one aspect in particular and that is the current preoccupation by many researchers with
what is in reality only a single facet of eupfology abductions.
The preoccupation with this and and please don't misunderstand me I admire
enormously the people who have given so much of their lives uh people like Bud
Hopkins for example to help us understand this aspect. But if we focus on that entirely, it distorts the
complex and multifaceted picture of extraterrestrial contact. It conditions
ourselves as well as the general public that aliens are by definition small gray beings with large dark eyes. And it
further gives the impression that alien contact equates only to abductions when in fact that is only one aspect.
It's become common place in recent years for many researchers to regard these events, the abductions, as the
understandable and necessary activity perhaps of a dying race or even as a
benevolent effort to genetically link our two races. But there's much about the whole abduction scenario that
disturbs me and leaves me strongly suspecting that much of it may be merely a cover for something else. As with UFOs
in general, the extraterrestrial hypothesis seems likely to be only one of several stimuli behind abductions. I
personally think that it is likely or possible at least that dimensional entities are involved in abductions
because they are what amounts to an intrusive and deceptive charade. Bud
Hopkins spoke about it just yesterday. I also think that perhaps the abducting grays are not necessarily what we assume
them to be. Their seeming lack of individuality and the hive mind mentality that's so often reported
indicates to me that perhaps at least some so-called grays may not be aliens at all, but rather biological robots
doing what is repetitive, dangerous, and menial for the more human appearing figures that are often reported lurking
in the background. So, for me personally, the jury is still well and truly out as far as abductions are
involved, but I'm left uncomfortable because of the violation of basic
individual rights that are so evident in so many abductions. The rapes, the coercion, the false predictions, the
false promises, the deception, and the trauma that results all seems to me
totally inconsistent when we're talking about an allegedly advanced race. But I
acknowledge that may too be only part of the picture. Likewise, the cries of conspiracy and
cover up while not denying that there are cover-ups, there are cover-ups. And I've given some good reasons, I believe,
uh why, but if we focus too much on that, they distract and finally can
drown more enduring truths. I've tried today to give some reasons
why I believe we can know some of the truth. We don't have to wait for the
government to give it to us. But there's a real danger on becoming so focused on
exposing these cover-ups that we can become oblivious to what is knowable by through careful systematic and probing
research. I don't believe anyone yet has the full picture of what's really going on in the world of alien contact. But I
believe that Udo Wartner's experience can tell us that we can know some important pieces of the puzzle. His 1940
encounter gives us the agenda of at least one extraterrestrial group that has long interacted with us. And that in
itself should be a key that enables us to understand other aspects of the gradually unfolding program of alien
disclosure. Let me just conclude on a personal note.
Just last November, I was able to fulfill uh one of my childhood dreams by
visiting Cape Canaveral for the first time and seeing the place where so many events of historical importance in our
space programs have taken place. It was there that it occurred to me that a part
of my fascination with UFOs is that some UFOs represent the space programs of
other worlds. In that sense, we can see something of our own future endeavors as
we make the planned transition from a terrestrial to a solar species and eventually to a galactic race. Let us
never forget that the future of the human family lies in space among the
stars and necessarily also among those who have also matured beyond their own birth planets. In last year's symposium,
I listened with great interest to a summary of some of the more subtle and far-reaching effects to the human psyche
that can result from encounters with UFOs and their occupants. And some of
these we actually see and they are apparent in Udo's life following his encounter. Let me just summarize them.
There's a tendency and we're generalizing here. We're talking about the big picture.
I think that means I've only got 15 minutes left. There is a tendency for many experiences to become vegetarian.
I'm not a vegetarian. And with apologies to any smokers, many of them feel the need to stop
smoking and drinking alcohol. They become more environmentally conscious, more globally aware. They often have a
desire to live rurally. They have a sense of personal mission in life and
almost always a heightened belief in a higher power and an increase in psychic abilities so-called.
Some of these as I say are apparent in Udo's life. But I think it's significant
that these tendencies and to me they're all positive things have been induced in ordinary people by
contact with the larger reality of the universe. Now whether these effects are
attributable to the actual alien contact itself or whether they just reflect the reawakening of the 20th century mind
from a fast food diet of convenience triviality and our parochialism.
I suggest that they point to what lies ahead of us as contact progresses. I
think we're looking at some of the things that are coming. Almost all of us hold a well-earned PhD
in reality avoidance in our culture and in our society.
From our birth, we've been conditioned to avoid some of the most obvious things in life.
Most of us have trouble facing inevitables such as death. Some of us tax.
For most people, a clear starry night is at best a thing of beauty to admire rather than also being a reminder of our
origins in our future. As eupfologists, among other things, we
need to stop avoiding the inevitable religious and philosophical implications
of extraterrestrial contact and start dealing with it with the profound connection between it all. I applaud the
efforts of people like Joe Lules who are trying to do that. The earthbound parochialism that
dominates and diminishes us and our culture and our belief systems and our
thinking is increasingly becoming confronted by reality. This is our
future. This is what it's really all about. This is where we're headed. And so it is eupfology perhaps more so
than any of the other sciences that forces us to face the three great realities of existence. Where did we
come from? What is this life really all about and what next?
This sudden and dramatic expansion of our collective collective awareness is not something that is going to happen in
the near future. It is happening now. The process of changing ourselves into
galactic citizens through the varied aspects of alien contact is well underway. But I also believe that our
birth into a new age of opportunity and peace will be a painful and difficult one. The revelations likely to come in
just the next few years have the potential to rock our society to the core.
So as this process of disclosure accelerates and this deepening interaction continues to intertwine the
human destiny, our destiny with that of other races, we must be prepared for whatever is coming. With the dawning of
a new century in such a short time now and the third millennium, perhaps the
time has come for all of us to make a course correction in the direction we're taking and to achieve a new openness to
accept what might lie ahead in the coming years. And I'm not talking just about euphology. I'm talking about it
all. I suspect that we have some surprises in store for all of us as the great cosmic drama between light and
darkness is played out and that as we face and hopefully embrace our real
origins and our ultimate destiny. Thank you for listening and God bless you.
